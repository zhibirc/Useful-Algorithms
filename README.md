Hi!

My aim here is to collect useful algorithms for various purposes realized on JavaScript. Some of them are self-developed or self-optimized.

Your are welcome to help me on this way! Here are the most valuable notes for participants:

- "one file --> one algorithm" rule;
- JSDoc is must;
- following the [jscs JavaScript Code Style](https://github.com/DarkPark/jscs)

All the best!
